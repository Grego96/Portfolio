        Hello, I'm Grego, a web developer and engineering student who became
        interested in programming after a few years of studying architecture,
        which led me to leave my degree to be able to study my current career. I
        am studying web development intensely through online and in-person
        courses and I am constantly expanding my knowledge on the subject so
        that one day I can be an experienced web developer and computer
        engineer.
